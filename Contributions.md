This project is a practical demonstration of what we've learned in the Data Structures and Algorithms course. We built and used several key data structures to show how they work. 
The core components of the project include the ArrayList (for fast lookups), the LinkedList (for efficient insertions/deletions), Stacks (for LIFO management), Queues 
(for FIFO processing), and Trees (for organizing hierarchical data and fast searching). This hands-on experience reflects our ability to use these different data structures.
